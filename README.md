# NightWatch

## The Night's Watch oath

> Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death.
> I shall live and die at my post. I am the watcher on the walls.
> I am the shield that guards the realms of servers.
> I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
