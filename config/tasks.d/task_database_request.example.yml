# This task allows to detect if a postgresql or mysql resquest is valid or not.
# To differenciate the type of request, type "postgresql" or "mysql" in the database_type variable
# To that, you have to give 4 mandatories parameters in the providers_options:
# - machine_addr : "localhost" or the ip of your machine.
# - database_name : name of your database model
# - user_database : user who has rights in your database
# - password_database : password ot the user previously written
# The "request" option is to know the request that you want to test.
# if the request response is not empty, then we consider that OK (success) else NOK (failed)
# - user_database
