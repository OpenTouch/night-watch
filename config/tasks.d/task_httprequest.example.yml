# This is an example of task using HttpRequest Provider.
# This task checks every 60 seconds ("period_success" parameter) if the web site www.google.com ("url" provider option) is available 
# (it expects the HTTP status code returned (provider option "requested_data") to be equals ("condition" parameter) to 200 ("threshold" parameter).
#
# If the site is unavailable, it retries an HTTP request 3 more times ("retries" parameter) with a 10s interval ("period_retry" parameter) before processing 
# the configured action(s).
# If the task fails (HTTP status code different than 200) 3 times successively, an email (set in "actions_failed" parameter) is sent.
# While the task is failed, it retries every 30s ("period_failed" parameter) to check if the site is avaiable again. If the task is back to success 
# (HTTP status code equal to 200) while it was failed, an email (set in "actions_success" parameter) is sent.
#
# Note that some Email Action's options are defined in actions.d/Email.yml file (mostly server options which should be common for all tasks).
#   - These options are used by Email Action without the need to redefine them in the task. 
#   - These options can be overloaded in the task configuration. If so, the value set in the task will apply instead of the one set in the Email.yml file.
